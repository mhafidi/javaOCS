# javaOCS
An Online Charging System (OCS) is a critical component in telecommunication networks that is responsible for real-time charging and balance management for various services such as voice calls, data sessions, messaging, etc. Below is a suggested high-level architecture of an OCS, along with the main components and their associated attributes:

###### 1-Service Control Function (SCF):

Responsible for handling service-specific charging logic.
 
 - **Attributes:**

    - **Service Identifier:** Unique identifier for the specific service being used.

    - **Service Type:** Type of service (e.g., voice, data, messaging).
    - **Charging Parameters:** Specific charging parameters for the service.
###### 2-Rating Function (RF):

Calculates the charges based on the service usage and charging logic.

- Attributes:
    - Tariff Information: Information about the applicable pricing plans and tariffs.
    - Charging Rules: Rules governing how charges are calculated for different services.
###### 3-Policy Control Function (PCF):

Enforces policies related to charging, access control, and quality of service (QoS).

- Attributes:
    - Policy Rules: Rules defining the charging behavior and access control.
###### 4-Account Balance Management (ABM):

Manages subscriber account balances and updates them in real-time during service usage.

- Attributes:
    - **Subscriber ID:** Unique identifier for the subscriber account.
    - **Balance:** Current account balance for the subscriber.
    - **Credit Limit:** Maximum allowed balance for a subscriber.
###### 5-Online Charging Data Record (OCDR) Collector:

Collects and processes real-time charging data records from various network elements.
Attributes:
Call ID / Session ID: Unique identifier for each communication session.
Start Time / End Time: Timestamps for session start and end.
Service Information: Details about the service used.
###### 6-Online Charging Data Record (OCDR) Database:

Stores the collected OCDRs for later processing and auditing.
Attributes:
Call Data Record Attributes: Attributes capturing session details (similar to the attributes mentioned earlier for CDRs).
###### 7-Charging Gateway (CG):

Acts as the interface between the OCS and the network elements that generate charging data.
Attributes:
Charging Data: Data generated by network elements during service usage.
###### 8-Mediation System:

Performs data transformation and enrichment of charging data for further processing and reporting.
Attributes:
Transformed Data: Data processed and standardized for further analysis.
###### 9-Fraud Detection and Prevention:

Analyzes charging patterns and usage data to detect potential fraudulent activities.
Attributes:
Anomaly Indicators: Indicators of suspicious usage patterns.
###### 10-Online Charging Interface (OCI):

Exposes APIs for external systems to interact with the OCS, allowing services to initiate real-time charging and balance updates.
Attributes:
Charging Requests and Responses: Data exchanged between external systems and OCS.
These components work together to enable real-time charging and balance management for telecommunication services. The attributes mentioned for each component represent a subset of the information they handle, and in real-world implementations, there may be additional attributes and more complex logic involved based on the specific requirements and the scale of the OCS.
